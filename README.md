# LLM Apps

LLM Apps is a collection of web applications related to Large Language Models (LLM).

## Getting Started



### Flashcard App

The Flashcard App is a web application that allows you to create and display interactive flashcards. It provides a user-friendly interface to create a grid of flashcards with customizable rows and columns. Each flashcard has a front and back side that can be flipped to reveal the information on the other side.
For more information and detailed instructions on using the Flashcard App, refer to the [Flashcard App README](flashcard/README.md).

### Blogger App

This is a Python application that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate blog posts and publish them on Google Blogger. The application generates text using the LLM and creates a new blog post with the generated content.

For more information and detailed instructions on using the Blogger App, refer to the [Blogger App README](blogger/README.md).

### Coming Soon

Stay tuned for more LLM-related apps that will be added to this repository.
